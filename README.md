# Â¡Hi! ðŸ‘‹ i'm @angenquinterol

I'm biomedical engineering and a recent Big Data specialist. I'm constantly learning technologies and new applications, innovotion in three areas. The first are is Data Engineering,    learning the new stuff to improve my skills in ETL and how to optimize data workflow. Also, i'm learning and applying statistical concepts in real problems to understand what i can do to solve them and how they work.
  
The last one is biomedical appication where i'm using ML, DL in medical images, specially XR in maxilofacial area to predict landmarks where can be used to perform cephalometric measurements to improve the precision. This points are used to determine facial patterns that need attention for later correction. This because one thing i also want to do is surgical virtual planning. This would be a good field to show my discipline, dedication and responsability
